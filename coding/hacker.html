  <h2>CY's Path to be a ... hacker? <font color="red">[not yet start]</font></h2>


<p>I was a great fan of <tt>esr</tt>'s article <i>How To Become A Hacker</i> [1]. For a very long time,
before I got a Linux computer and before I learnt Pascal in F.4~F.5 (Grade 10~11). </p>

<p>It turns out that after many years, I have my opinion separated from my virtual mentor(here I mean the article).</p>

<h4>Is there a definitely best beginner programming language?</h4>

<p>I would love to say my first programming language is LOGO &dash; which I learnt in the last year of primary
school (Grade 6), rather than Pascal, though I never write something delicated in LOGO.</p>

<p>I do not agree that Python is a good choice of THE first programming language.
It has been used in application formally and there are common practices that newbies may not know. 
To have an counter recommendation, I would say: you should learn more than one languages to begin!
I guess the good combination is Scheme/LISP (okay... where LOGO is dervied from), C (C is complicated; 
but according to a friend, her school used C instead of Pascal for the high schoolers. Therefore I think
there are possibilities that using C to start well.) or Smalltalk,
and then a scripting language (the three rivalries: Perl/Python/Ruby). That is, about 3 languages:
(Scheme or LISP) + (C or Smalltalk) + (Perl/Python/Ruby). </p>

<p>Why do I suggest so? This is because one may be restricted to use a definite paradigms in
Scheme/LISP("approximately" functional), Smalltalk(object-oriented, abbr. as OO) and Ruby(OO).
Hence they get on the paradigms fast. A scripting language is needed, to test ideas or do handy tasks,
and save time for compiling.</p>

<p>(I would like to mention that Perl coders can understand Python easily, and the reverse seems not true.
And, people heard of OO can choose Ruby to begin. Disclaimer:
I only know Perl, and write some nano-size programs in Python; knowledge about Ruby, but as I learnt OO through
Java and Smalltalk, I doesn't plan to be repetitive.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the first programming language(S) is quite a personal choice. If you have a friend willing to guide you
in Rust or Clojure, it might be better than self-taught.</p>

<p>That's all for my passage on languages at this moment.</p>

<h4>Attitudes</h4>

<p><u>The rest of this blogpost is written for myself.</u> I noted some rules of thumb for a good hacker here.</p>

<p>1. "The world is full of fasciating problems waiting to be solved." [1] Such a good news for a person loves mathematics.</p>

<p>2. "No problem should ever have to be solved twice." [1] Don't reinvent your wheel (DRY). Maybe there is more than DRY &dash; programming paradigms like OO and functional programming are trying to reuse codes. </p>

<p>3. "Freedom is good." [1] Will it lead to a debate on political philosophy or applied ethics? I did't study philosophy.
Maybe spaces for diversity is good as well.</p>

<p>4. "You are not your code;"[4] <i>but it reflects what kind of person you are,
and more seriously, affects the users and fellow programmers [5].</i> Lots of stressed 
talks on being a programmer for living emphasize the importance of communication.</p>

<p>5. "The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position."[4] This is about a flat structure of a team.</p>

<p>In the future, I will go back to this post and review how much I have done and elaborates these ideas. &squ;</p>
